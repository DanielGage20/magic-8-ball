<p> Descripton about the magic 8 ball game.</p>
I have decided to create a Magic 8 ball game for Project 2 with Code Institute. 
<p> Images. </p>


<p> My Magic 8 Ball game will have very basic HTML and CSS coding, with the Javascript being the most important part of my Project.<br>
It will feature a title asking "What's your future?<br>
There will be an image of a hand holding an Magic 8 Ball.<br>
The last section of my site will be a button saying "Ask me anything"<br>
This will bring up a prompt box where the user can ask any question and they will get a random answer.</p>

<p>Testing: lighthouse, bugs,html, css,javascript.</p>
