<h1>Magic 8 ball Game.</h1>

<p>I have decided to create a Magic 8 ball game for Project 2 with Code Institute.</p>

<p>My Magic 8 Ball game will have very basic HTML and CSS coding, with the Javascript being the most important part of my Project.<br>
It will feature a title asking "What's your future?"<br>
There will be an image of a hand holding an Magic 8 Ball.<br>
The last section of my site will be a button saying "Ask me anything"<br>
This will bring up a prompt box where the user can ask any question and they will get a random answer.</p>

<h2>Bugs</h2>
<p>Some of the bugs I encountered were the main image, when it came to deploying my site. The image was not showing, this was because I was using an absolute path, I rectified this by changing my path to relative.<br> Once I deployed my site again, there was an issue with the background of my image. <br>The back ground was white instead of my chosen color, so I simply changed my background to color to the image background color.</p>
<br>
<p>Another bug I encountered was in my Javascript code, at first my code was bringing up all of the answers at once rather than one random answer.<br>
This was because I had not used a numbered array and assigned each answer a number for the Math.floor(Math.random() * 12); code to work.
  Once I assigned each answer a number, it then worked and my site now comes up with a random answer<p>
  

<h2>Deployment</h2>
<p>To deploy this page to GitHub Pages from its GitHub repository, the following steps were taken:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Log into GitHub.</li>
  <li>From the list of repositories on the screen, select https://danielgage20.github.io/magic-8-ball/</li>
  <li>From the menu items near the top of the page, select Settings.</li>
  <li>Scroll down to the GitHub Pages section.</li>
  <li>Under Source click the drop-down menu labelled None and select Master Branch</li>
  <li>On selecting Master Branch the page is automatically refreshed, the website is now deployed.</li>
  <li>Scroll back down to the GitHub Pages section to retrieve the link to the deployed website.</li>
  </ul>
